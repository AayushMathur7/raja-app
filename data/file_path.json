The logging level is set to DEBUG, which means all log messages will be captured.\n\nThe app includes two endpoints:\n- The root endpoint (\"/\") returns a simple \"Hello, World!\" message and logs the event.\n- The \"/v1/status\" endpoint returns a JSON response with the current stage of the workflow and an estimated time to completion. The event is also logged.\n\nPlease note that this is just a basic implementation of logging and may need further customization based on the specific requirements of the application.",
