[Output only code with no comments, no file path on top]
As an AI programmer, you're tasked with debugging a piece of code in a bug ticket.

Here's the information for this task:

name: {name}
label: {label}
description: {description}
how_to_reproduce: {how_to_reproduce}
acceptance_criteria: {acceptance_criteria}

Your task is to debug the code and return the corrected code for the file with filepath, {current_filepath}.

Here are all the filepaths and the file contents to help you understand the existing codebase:
{file_objects}

Here are some debugging guidelines:

- **Read the error message carefully.** It often provides clues about the error's cause.
- **Step through the code line by line.** This can help identify where the error is occurring.
- **Use a debugger.** A debugger can help you step through the code line by line and see the values of variables.
- **Follow coding standards.** Ensure that the code adheres to Python's PEP 8 style guide to maintain readability and avoid common errors.
- **Use assertion checks.** Don't assume that variables have the values you expect. Validate your assumptions with assertions.
- **Avoid hard-coding values if possible.**
- **Search for the error online.** Many resources can help you debug code.

After debugging, your response should and only should contain the entire corrected python code file, keeping the same format as the input code.
DO NOT just give me the proposed changes, but give me the entire file with the changes.
Make sure that your response does not have any comments - it should only contain the entire file and nothing else.
Your response should not have any other remarks. Make sure of this.

If no changes are required for the file, reply with the original file content for {current_filepath}.
