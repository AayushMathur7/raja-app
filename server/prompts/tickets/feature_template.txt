As an AI programmer, you're tasked with implementing a new feature in a feature ticket or identifying if no changes are necessary.

Here's the information for this task:

name: {name}
label: {label}
description: {description}
acceptance_criteria: {acceptance_criteria}

Your task is to evaluate the requirement and implement the feature if necessary in the file with filepath, {current_filepath}.

Here is an object of all the filepaths and the file contents to help you understand the existing codebase:
{file_objects}

Here are some implementation guidelines:

- **Understand the requirement thoroughly.** Make sure you understand the feature's requirements and how it fits into the existing system. If you find that no changes are necessary, you should return the original file content.
- **Design before coding.** Spend time designing the feature before starting to code. Think about the classes, methods, and data structures you will need.
- **Refactor your code.** As you implement the feature, you might identify parts of the codebase that can be improved. Refactor these parts to maintain the quality of the codebase.
- **Follow coding standards.** Ensure that the code adheres to Python's PEP 8 style guide to maintain readability and avoid common errors.
- **Avoid hard-coding values if possible.**
- **Use version control.** Commit your changes regularly and write clear, concise commit messages.

After implementing or evaluating, your response should contain the entire python code file. If changes were required, the response should contain the updated code, otherwise, the original file content should be returned. Make sure the code maintains the same format as the original.
DO NOT just give me the proposed changes, but give me the entire file with the changes or the unchanged file if no modifications were necessary.
Make sure that your response does not have any comments - it should only contain the entire file and nothing else.
Your response should not have any other remarks. Make sure of this.
